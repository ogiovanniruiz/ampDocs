Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately. Installation in a virtual environment The best way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a virtual environment . Don't know what this is or how to set it up? We recommend to start by reading a tutorial on virtual environments for Python. Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you could be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and Material for MkDocs through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes. with docker recommended The official Docker image is a great way to get up and running in a few minutes, as it comes with all dependencies pre-installed. Pull the image for the latest version with: docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material The mkdocs executable is provided as an entry point and serve is the default command. Start the development server in your project root \u2013 the folder where mkdocs.yml resides \u2014 with: === \"Unix\" ``` docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material ``` === \"Windows\" ``` docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v \"%cd%\":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material ``` with git Material for MkDocs can be directly used from GitHub by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you want to use the very latest version: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Configuration Depending on your installation method, you can now add the following lines to mkdocs.yml in your project root. If you installed Material for MkDocs using a package manager, add: theme: name: material If you cloned Material for MkDocs from GitHub add: theme: name: null custom_dir: mkdocs-material/material MkDocs includes a development server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The development server can be started with the following command: mkdocs serve Point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and your documentation should greet you in a new look. If you're starting from scratch, the following configuration can be used as a starting point: ??? summary \"Example configuration\" This is an excerpt from the [`mkdocs.yml`][9] used to render these pages: ``` yaml # Project information site_name: Material for MkDocs site_description: A Material Design theme for MkDocs site_author: Martin Donath site_url: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ # Repository repo_name: squidfunk/mkdocs-material repo_url: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material # Copyright copyright: Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2020 Martin Donath # Configuration theme: name: material language: en palette: primary: indigo accent: indigo font: text: Roboto code: Roboto Mono # Extras extra: social: - icon: fontawesome/brands/github-alt link: https://github.com/squidfunk - icon: fontawesome/brands/twitter link: https://twitter.com/squidfunk - icon: fontawesome/brands/linkedin link: https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk # Google Analytics google_analytics: - UA-XXXXXXXX-X - auto # Extensions markdown_extensions: - admonition - codehilite: guess_lang: false - toc: permalink: true ``` Feature flags These optional features are hidden behind flags and can be explicitly enabled in mkdocs.yml . Instant loading :hatching_chick: The (still experimental) instant loading feature will intercept clicks on all internal links and dispatch them directly via XHR without a full page reload. It can be enabled from mkdocs.yml with: theme: features: - instant The resulting page is parsed and injected and all event handlers and components are automatically rebound. This means that Material for MkDocs behaves like a Single Page Application , which is especially useful for large documentation sites that come with a huge search index, as the search index will now remain intact in-between document switches. Tabs The tabs feature will render top-level subsections in another navigational layer below the header on big screens (but leave them untouched on mobile). It can be enabled from mkdocs.yml with: theme: features: - tabs Note that all top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml will be grouped under the first tab which will receive the title of the first page. This means that there will effectively be no collapsible subsections for the first tab, as each subsection is rendered as another tab. If you want more fine-grained control, i.e., collapsible subsections for the first tab, you can move all top-level pages into a subsection , so that the top-level is entirely made up of subsections. Note that tabs are only shown for larger screens, so make sure that navigation is plausible on mobile devices. As an example, see the mkdocs.yml used to render these pages. Language Default: en Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n) and provides translations for all template variables and labels. You can set the language from mkdocs.yml with: theme: language: en The following language codes are supported: .md-language-list { -webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2; columns: 2; } .md-language-list li { -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid; } af / Afrikaans ar / Arabic my / Burmese ca / Catalan zh / Chinese (Simplified) zh-Hant / Chinese (Traditional) zh-TW / Chinese (Taiwanese) hr / Croatian cs / Czech da / Danish nl / Dutch en / English et / Estonian fi / Finnish fr / French gl / Galician de / German gr / Greek he / Hebrew hi / Hindi hu / Hungarian id / Indonesian it / Italian ja / Japanese kr / Korean no / Norwegian nn / Norwegian (Nynorsk) fa / Persian pl / Polish pt / Portuguese ro / Romanian ru / Russian sr / Serbian sh / Serbo-Croatian sk / Slovak si / Slovenian es / Spanish sv / Swedish th / Thai tr / Turkish uk / Ukrainian vi / Vietnamese Add language While many languages are read ltr (left-to-right), Material for MkDocs also supports rtl (right-to-left) directionality which is inferred from the selected language, but can also be set with: theme: direction: rtl Color scheme Default: default Material for MkDocs supports two color schemes: a light mode, which is just called default , and a dark mode, which is called slate . The color scheme can be set from mkdocs.yml : theme: palette: scheme: slate Click on a color name to change the color scheme of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-primary-bg-color); background-color: var(--md-primary-fg-color); } default slate var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-scheme]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-scheme\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) The color scheme can also be set based on user preference , which makes use of the prefers-color-scheme media query. This can be done by adding the following to mkdocs.yml : theme: palette: scheme: preference Color palette The Material Design color palette comes with 20 hues, all of which are included with Material for MkDocs. Primary and accent colors can be set from the project root's mkdocs.yml : theme: palette: primary: indigo accent: indigo If the colors are set with these configuration options, an additional CSS file that includes the hues of the color palette is automatically included and linked from the template. ??? tip \"Custom colors with CSS variables\" Material for MkDocs defines all colors as CSS variables. If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand's colors), you can add an [additional stylesheet][11] and override the defaults: ``` css :root { /* Default color shades */ --md-default-fg-color: ...; --md-default-fg-color--light: ...; --md-default-fg-color--lighter: ...; --md-default-fg-color--lightest: ...; --md-default-bg-color: ...; --md-default-bg-color--light: ...; --md-default-bg-color--lighter: ...; --md-default-bg-color--lightest: ...; /* Primary color shades */ --md-primary-fg-color: ...; --md-primary-fg-color--light: ...; --md-primary-fg-color--dark: ...; --md-primary-bg-color: ...; --md-primary-bg-color--light: ...; /* Accent color shades */ --md-accent-fg-color: ...; --md-accent-fg-color--transparent: ...; --md-accent-bg-color: ...; --md-accent-bg-color--light: ...; /* Code block color shades */ --md-code-bg-color: ...; --md-code-fg-color: ...; } ``` Primary color Default: indigo Click on a color name to change the primary color of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-primary-bg-color); background-color: var(--md-primary-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange brown grey blue grey black white var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-primary\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) Accent color Default: indigo Click on a color name to change the accent color of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-accent-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-accent\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) Fonts Default: Roboto and Roboto Mono The Roboto font family is the default font included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to any valid webfont, like for example the Ubuntu font family : theme: font: text: Ubuntu code: Ubuntu Mono The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use Google Fonts for data privacy reasons, just set font to false : theme: font: false Icons Default: material/library and fontawesome/brands/git-alt Material for MkDocs uses icons in several places. Currently, the following icons can be changed from mkdocs.yml : the logo icon, the repository icon and the social link icons . While the social link icons are tied to the respective entries, the other icons can be changed by referencing a valid path (without the trailing .svg ) relative to the .icons folder which comes with the theme: theme: icon: logo: material/library repo: fontawesome/brands/git-alt All icons are directly inlined as *.svg files, so no further requests will be made. Icon sets which are bundled with Material for MkDocs: Material Design icons ( material ): 5.1k icons FontAwesome icons ( fontawesome ): 1.6k icons GitHub's Octicons ( octicons ): 200 icons You can use all those icons directly from :fontawesome-brands-markdown: Markdown ! Logo Default: icon set through theme.icon.logo If you want to replace the icon in the header (screen) and drawer (mobile) with your brand's logo, you can place an image file in your docs folder and use the following option in mkdocs.yml : theme: logo: images/logo.svg Ideally, the image should be a square with a minimum resolution of 96x96, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header and drawer. Favicon Default: assets/images/favicon.png The default favicon can be changed with: theme: favicon: images/favicon.png Extras Adding a source repository To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : repo_name: squidfunk/mkdocs-material repo_url: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Additionally, for GitHub and GitLab, the number of stars and forks is shown. Note that the repository icon can be explicitly set through theme.icon.repo . Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding social links Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the icons which are bundled with the theme. Note that each icon must point to a valid path (without the trailing .svg ) relative to the .icons folder which comes with the theme: extra: social: - icon: fontawesome/brands/github-alt link: https://github.com/squidfunk - icon: fontawesome/brands/twitter link: https://twitter.com/squidfunk - icon: fontawesome/brands/linkedin link: https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk By default, the link title will be set to the domain name, e.g. github.com . If you want to set a discernable name, e.g., to improve your Lighthouse score, you can set the name attribute on each social link. Adding a Web App Manifest A Web App Manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. You can specify such a manifest in mkdocs.yml : extra: manifest: manifest.webmanifest Integrations Google Analytics MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. To enable tracking, which is disabled by default, you must add your tracking identifier to mkdocs.yml : google_analytics: - UA-XXXXXXXX-X - auto Besides basic page views, site search can also be tracked to better understand how people use your documentation and what they expect to find. To enable search tracking: Go to your Google Analytics admin settings Select the property for the respective tracking code Go to the view settings tab. Scroll down and enable site search settings Set the query parameter to q . Disqus Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in mkdocs.yml : extra: disqus: your-shortname The comments section is inserted on every page, except the index page . The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements Note that site_url must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Disqus integration to load properly. Disqus can also be enabled or disabled for specific pages using Metadata . Extensions Markdown comes with several very useful extensions, the following of which are not enabled by default but highly recommended, so enabling them should definitely be a good idea: markdown_extensions: - admonition - codehilite: guess_lang: false - toc: permalink: true See the following list of extensions supported by Material for MkDocs including some more information on configuration and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Plugins MkDocs' plugin architecture makes it possible to add pre- or post-processing steps that sit between the theme and your documentation.

Configuration Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - admonition Usage Admonitions follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title By default, the Admonition title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks \u2013 except code blocks, because the parser from the standard Markdown library does not account for those. The PyMdown Extensions package adds an extension called SuperFences , which makes it possible to nest code blocks within other blocks, respectively Admonition blocks. Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. ``` mysql SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.Name, Employees.Salary, Manager.Name AS Manager FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager ON Employees.ManagerID = Manager.EmployeeID WHERE Employees.EmployeeID = '087652'; ``` Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks The Details extension which is also part of the PyMdown Extensions package adds support for rendering collapsible Admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. Example: ??? note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: ??? note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. By adding a + sign directly after the start marker, blocks can be rendered open by default. Types Admonition supports user-defined type qualifiers which may influence the style of the inserted block. Following is a list of type qualifiers provided by Material for MkDocs, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note .

We aim to do this by building coalitions of grassroots, labor, and community leaders that are committed to transforming our local communities.
