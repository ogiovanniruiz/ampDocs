## Create a Target

1. Begin by giving your target a **Target Name** and select if this is a **AND** or **OR** (In this instance we are setting the rule to "AND")

2. Next you want to choose a **Rule** or **Ruleset** to add your parameters.

5. Now fill in the value for your rule. (in this example we'll use **25**)

6. We'll also added another rule for **blockgroups** to include the ([locked blockgroups][2]) in previous documentation for this example. This also adds another layer of filter for our results. You can add as many rules as you want. Once your rules are in place you can press the **"# HouseHolds: 0 # Residents: 0"** button to make your calculations.

7. Your calculations will show how many **HouseHolds** and **Residents** you will be targeting.
<br><br>

8. You can also make this target available for every campaign by checking the **Campaign Wide** checkbox (optional).
