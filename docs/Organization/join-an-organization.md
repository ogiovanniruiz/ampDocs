# Join An Organization

## Before you start

Here are some things to know before you begin this process.

* The user will **only** be making a request to join the organization. Approval is still need from an admin or lead within the organization after you complete this process ([See Add User To Organization][1])

## Request to Join an Organization

1. To join an organization you will have to make a request first. To do so, you will have to click the **orange plus button** on the right side of the screen.
