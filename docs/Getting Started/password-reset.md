# Password Reset

## Forgotten Password Reset

1. If you  have forgotten your password, you can reset it when you are logged out by clicking **FORGOT PASSWORD**.

2. You will be prompted for the **email address** you used on your account. **Send recovery email**.

If an active account with that email exists, the user will be sent a secure link to the opportunity to reset their password.

## Password Security

You are mailed a secure link to maintain security of your account. Only an email address associated with an existing account on Amplify will be recognized and receive a link for a password reset. This is done to ensure that only you, the true owner of your email account, can reset your password, not just anyone who knows your email address.

1. Enter your **New Password** twice and click **Submit**.
