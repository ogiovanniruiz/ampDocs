To edit a COI, click on the gold 'Enable Edit Mode' button found on the left hand side of the map. When enabled, the button will turn blue. When disabled, the button will be gold. By enabling editing, all of your organization's COIs will be editable and all other other organizations' COIs will be clonable.

When editing is enabled, you may click on one of your COI's to open the Edit Dialog. Once again, a name and description are required to save changes.
