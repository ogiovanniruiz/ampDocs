There are two ways to create a new COI. A COI can be created by drawing a custom shape with the Draw Tool or by selecting one or more block groups with the Lasso Tool. Let's start with the Draw Tool.

1. First, click on the polygon tool at the top right. 
2. Then draw out the polygon so that it connects back on itself.

3 Once the polygon has been drawn it will turn red. You may now click on it to open the creation dialog.

4 The dialog will ask for the name of the new COI as well as a description of the COI. Both are required. When you click the blue 'Create COI' button, it will save the COI as part of your organization's layer.

Now let's go over the Lasso Tool.
Another way to create a COI is to use the Lasso Tool to select one or more Blockgroups and construct a COI out of the selected blockgroups. Blockgrups become visible once the users zooms in on the map. The Lasso Tool can be found at the top right-hand-side of the screen. 

1. Use the tool to draw an encompassing shape around the blockgroups you wish to select.
