# Join An Campaign

## Before you start

Here are some things to know before you begin this process.

* The user will **only** be making a request to join the campaign. Approval is still needed from an admin or lead within the campaign after you complete this process.

## Request to join an campaign

1. To join a campaign you will have to make a request first. To do so, you will have to click the **orange plus button** on the right side of the screen.
