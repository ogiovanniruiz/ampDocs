# Getting started

## What is Amplify

IE United was created with the intention to restructureÂ leadership and culture in the Inland Empire to more accurately represent the identities and progressive values of the residents. We aim to do this by building coalitions of grassroots, labor, and community leaders that are committed to transforming our local communities. We have a record of identifying corrupt policies and ineffective leaders that have sold out our communities for too long. We will directly challenge these leaders, remove them from office, and replace them with people who better reflect our values and priorities.
